# Online Auction System (ASP .NET MVC)

This project creates an online auction system for a diverse range of items. Users can list items (name, description, images, minimum bid) and bid competitively.

An admin module safeguards the system. Administrators can manage shop categories (create, merge, monitor) and combat fraudulent activity.

## Key Features:

**User Registration & Login**: Two user types - Administrators and Normal Users - register and log in.

**Home Page:** Users encounter a dashboard offering:
*  Search bar for specific items.
*  Category list with item counts.
*  "Sell an Item" link for new listings.

- Search Functionality: Users can search for currently available auction items (case-insensitive).

**Selling an Item:** Users can:
*  Provide title and description.
*  Upload images/documents.
*  Set minimum bid price and end date.

**Category Browsing:** Users can browse specific categories to view available items.

**Viewing Item Details:** Clicking on search results or browsing categories displays item details:
*  Title, description, images, documents.
*  Seller's name (linked to rating page).
*  Minimum/current bid price.
*  Bid history link.

**Bid increment.**
 "New Bid" button (except for seller).

 **Editing an Item:** Sellers can update images, documents, and bid increment.

**Notifications:** Sellers and buyers receive notifications upon auction completion for communication regarding item shipment.

**Optional Rating System:** A system can be implemented for buyers and sellers to rate each other (from -5 to +5) for reputation management.

**Administrator Functions:** Admins can block fraudulent users, manage shop categories, and ensure system integrity.
